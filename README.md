**A collection of design pattern implementations in Swift**  
Explore practical examples of software design patterns written in clean, modern Swift.

---

## Patterns Implemented

### Creational
- **Unit of Work** — Aggregate operations under a single transaction interface.

*(Add more patterns here as you expand the project.)*
